module.exports.gulambha = "Gulambha";

//console.log(module); This guy is always printed regardless, while imported.
// as, the whole file when required somewhere, would be wraped in a function and would be executed.

// Here, export is an object of the module, and remember WE SHARE THE MINIMUM.

//module.exports = { john };
// So on this side we have exported them, on the other side we gotta 'require' them.
