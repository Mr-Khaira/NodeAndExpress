## Introduction to Node.js and Express Framework

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase the foundational concepts of Node.js and the Express framework, essential for building robust backend solutions in modern web development. Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of key concepts and techniques in backend development.

### What I've Learned

1. **Synchronous and Asynchronous JavaScript**: Understanding the fundamental difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution is crucial for efficient backend development.

2. **Node.js Built-in Modules**: Exploring core Node.js modules such as 'os' and 'path' equips me with essential tools for system interaction and file manipulation.

3. **File System Operations**: Delving into reading and writing files in Node.js elucidates the synchronous nature of code execution and its implications on file handling.

4. **Advantages of Express**: Recognizing why Express.js is preferred over basic HTTP modules in Node.js for building scalable and maintainable backend architectures.

5. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Utilizing NPM for dependency management streamlines the development process by providing access to a vast ecosystem of packages and libraries.

6. **Middleware Functions**: Mastering middleware functions in Express enables efficient request handling and customization of server behavior.

7. **Express Built-in Functions**: Exploring essential functions like `use()` and `Router()` facilitates the creation of modular and organized route handling within Express applications.

8. **HTTP Methods**: Understanding major HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE enables the implementation of RESTful APIs for seamless communication between clients and servers.

9. **Experimentation with Bootstrap**: Exploring front-end frameworks like Bootstrap enhances my understanding of responsive web design and user interface development.
